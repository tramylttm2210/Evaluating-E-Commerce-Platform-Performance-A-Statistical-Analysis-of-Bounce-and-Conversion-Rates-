# Evaluating-E-Commerce-Platform-Performance-A-Statistical-Analysis-of-Bounce-and-Conversion-Rates-
## Purpose
Evaluate user engagement (bounce rate) and conversion efficiency for a website using session data and industry benchmarks (Mobiloud 2025, Adobe 2023), providing data-driven insights and recommendations for optimization.
---

## Tools & Packages
- **R** with:
  - `tidyverse` (`dplyr`, `readr`)
  - `stats` (t-test, binomial test)
  - `ggplot2`
- **Data Sources**:
  - Mobiloud (2025) bounce rate benchmark
  - Adobe (2023) conversion rate benchmark

---

## Techniques & Workflow
- **Data Standardization & Validation**: Processed 12,330 session records to calculate bounce and conversion rates; benchmarked against Mobiloud (2025) and Adobe (2023) standards.
- **Statistical Testing**:
  - **One-sample left-tailed t-test** on bounce rates (H₀: μ = 45.68%) → t = –995.27, p < 0.001 confirming bounce rate (~2.22%) is significantly below industry average.
  - **One-sample right-tailed exact binomial test** on conversions (p₀ = 3.65%) → observed 15.47%, p < 0.001, 95% CI lower bound = 14.9%, indicating conversion rate exceeds benchmark by over 4×.
- **Data Visualization**: Employed `ggplot2` to illustrate:
  - **Histogram** of session bounce rates vs. benchmark
  - **Bar chart** of conversion rates with confidence intervals
  - **Funnel diagram** showcasing drop-off and conversion steps

## Key Insights
- **Exceptional Engagement**: Bounce rate of ~2.22% vastly outperforms the 45.68% benchmark, reflecting highly engaging landing experiences.
- **High Conversion Efficiency**: Conversion rate of 15.47% (≥14.9% lower CI) is more than four times the 3.65% industry standard, indicating an optimized purchase funnel.
- **Strategic Recommendations**:
  - Implement targeted **A/B testing** on landing page elements.
  - Conduct **user-segmentation analyses** to sustain low bounce among diverse audiences.
  - Establish **continuous monitoring** via dashboards to track key metrics over time.
