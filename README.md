# E-commerce Engagement & Conversion Performance Analysis

## Purpose  
To evaluate a platform's user engagement and conversion performance using statistical hypothesis testing. The analysis benchmarks bounce and conversion rates from 12,330 e-commerce sessions against industry standards (Mobiloud, 2025; Adobe, 2023) to assess platform efficiency and identify actionable optimization strategies.

## Tools & Packages  
**Data Cleaning & Analysis:** `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `stats`  
**Visualization:** `ggplot2`, `plotly`  
**Statistical Tests:**  
- One-sample left-tailed *t*-test for bounce rate  
- One-sample right-tailed binomial test for conversion rate  

## Project Overview  
Standardized and validated bounce and conversion metrics across 12,330 sessions. Applied statistical inference to compare performance with accepted benchmarks:
- **Bounce Rate Benchmark:** 45.68% (Mobiloud, 2025)  
- **Conversion Rate Benchmark:** 3.65% (Adobe, 2023)  

## Engagement Performance: Bounce Rate Analysis  
 
The bounce rate is **significantly lower** than the industry average, indicating exceptional user engagement. This suggests effective landing page design, intuitive navigation, and compelling content that encourage users to stay and explore the site.

## Conversion Performance: Sales Funnel Analysis  
  
The conversion rate is **more than four times** the industry average, reflecting an optimized user experience and high purchase efficiency. The result suggests strong product-market fit, effective trust-building, and streamlined checkout flow.

## Forecasting & Optimization Recommendations  
- **A/B Testing:** Evaluate landing page elements, calls to action, and checkout UX to identify performance drivers.  
- **User Segmentation:** Analyze behavior by device type, traffic source, and user status (new vs. returning).  
- **Monitoring:** Continuously track bounce and conversion rates to detect seasonal or campaign-based changes.  
- **Sustainability:** Investigate whether current performance is short-term (e.g., promotions) or reflective of long-term design quality.

## Actionable Insight  
- The platform **greatly outperforms** standard e-commerce metrics.  
- Stakeholders should **leverage this strong foundation** through targeted experimentation and deeper UX analysis to maintain and improve performance.  
- Further study is encouraged to **identify causality**, ensuring that what works today continues to work tomorrow.
